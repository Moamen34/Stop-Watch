ðŸš€ Project Completion: Dual-Mode Stopwatch with ATmega32! ðŸ•’
Thrilled to announce the successful completion of my latest embedded systems projectâ€”a fully functional stopwatch with both count down and count up modes, powered by the ATmega32 microcontroller!
ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
Dual Modes: Seamless switch between countdown and countup functionalities.

Precise Timing: Utilizes Timer1 in CTC mode for accurate timekeeping.
Interrupt-Driven Control: External interrupts enable intuitive controls like reset, pause, and resume for enhanced usability.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with multiple buttons for easy time setting, including separate controls for hours, minutes, and seconds.

Multiplexed Display: Six 7-segment displays are controlled using a multiplexing method for clear and responsive time display.

This project helped me dive deeper into the power of AVR microcontrollers, real-time processing with timers, and efficient use of interrupts for event handling. ðŸš€
Grateful for all the learning and looking forward to applying this knowledge in future projects.
